This is the readme file for:
	0x00. Pagination.

- Pagination:
	Most endpoints that returns a list of entities will need to have some sort of pagination.

	Without pagination, a simple search could return millions or even billions of hits causing extraneous network traffic.

	Paging requires an implied ordering. By default this may be the itemâ€™s unique identifier, but can be other ordered fields such as a created date.

- Offset Pagination:
	This is the simplest form of paging.
	Limit/Offset became popular with apps using SQL databases which already have LIMIT and OFFSET as part of the SQL SELECT Syntax.
	Very little business logic is required to implement Limit/Offset paging.

	Limit/Offset Paging would look like GET /items?limit=20&offset=100. This query would return the 20 rows starting with the 100th row.

- Example:
	(Assume the query is ordered by created date descending)

	Client makes request for most recent items: GET /items?limit=20
	On scroll/next page, client makes second request GET /items?limit=20&offset=20
	On scroll/next page, client makes third request GET /items?limit=20&offset=40
	As a SQL statement, the third request would look like:
----------------
SELECT
    *
FROM
    Items
ORDER BY Id
LIMIT 20
OFFSET 40;
----------------

- Benefits:
	Easiest to implement, almost no coding required other than passing parameters directly to SQL query.

	Stateless on the server.

	Works regardless of custom sort_by parameters.
